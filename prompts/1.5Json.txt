Please transcribe and expand all details from this herbarium label and output the result as a JSON object. Do not include any full stops. If there is no information present for a field, insert "N/A". If any text is in a language other than English, do not translate. If unsure about any detail, insert “unsure and check”. Follow this exact structure for the fields:

{
  "verbatimCollectors": "(The collectors as you see it on the label. This might be one collector, a string of collectors, that collected the sample. Collected by or collectors may be prefixed by leg. or sometimes legit.)",
  "collectedBy": "(The First Collector, only capitalize names. Collected by or collectors may be prefixed by leg. or sometimes legit. The collector’s name should be formatted with the first and/or middle names abbreviated and the last name spelled out, e.g., R. M. Schuster. Spacing is required between the first, middle, and last names.)",
  "secondaryCollectors": "(These are collectors listed after the first, only capitalize names. The names should be formatted with the first and/or middle names abbreviated and the last name spelled out, e.g., R. M. Schuster. Spacing is required between the first, middle, and last names. Separate multiple collectors by a pipe, i.e., |.)",
  "recordNumber": "(An identifier given to the specimen at the time it was recorded - this is the collection number by the person who collected the specimen. If not present, put “s.n.”)",
  "verbatimEventDate": "(The Verbatim Date field is used to record the collection date exactly as shown on the label - with no correction of spacing or anything else. Precisely as appearing on label. If not present, put “s.d.”)",
  "minimumEventDate": "(The date the specimen was collected. Convert the date to an ISO-8601 numeric format (YYYY-MM-DD). Note that unknown month and days can be entered as '00'. For example, a collection with a date of 'March 1956' can be entered as '1956-03-00'. If the date is singular or the start of a range, use it.)",
  "maximumEventDate": "(Used for the last date in a range. If there is no range, insert N/A. Do not repeat the minimumEventDate. Convert the date to an ISO-8601 numeric format (YYYY-MM-DD). Note that unknown month and days can be entered as '00'. For example, a collection with a date of 'March 1956' can be entered as '1956-03-00'.)",
  "verbatimIdentification": "(A string representing the taxonomic identification as it appeared on the original label. This term is meant to allow the capture of an unaltered original identification/determination, including identification qualifiers, hybrid formulas, uncertainties, etc. Precisely as appearing on the label.)",
  "latestScientificName": "(If there are multiple scientific names, select the one with the latest determination date. This might be on an extra label. A scientific name is typically a binomial with a genus name and species name. Sometimes there might be a variety or subspecies identified by var. or subsp. Strip the taxonomic authority (appears as a person's name and not a Latin name) and just provide the Latin binomial.)",
  "identifiedBy": "(This is the person who identified the specimen, sometimes represented by Det. or det. or determined by. The name should be formatted with the first and/or middle names abbreviated and the last name spelled out, e.g., R. M. Schuster. Spacing is required between the first, middle, and last names. There might be multiple labels reflecting this. If unsure, insert 'unsure and check'. If no information, insert 'N/A'.)",
  "verbatimDateIdentified": "(The date on which the subject was identified as representing the Taxon. This is not eventDate, so make sure to differentiate. Precisely as appearing on label.)",
  "associatedTaxa": "(This is a taxonomic name that may be directly associated with the acceptedScientificName, i.e., it is growing directly with the acceptedScientificName. This is not a scientific name associated with the general forest or vegetation that describes the habitat. Strip the taxonomic authority (appears as a person's name and not a Latin name) and just provide the Latin binomial.)",
  "country": "(The name of the country or major administrative unit in which the event occurred. Please find and enter the current name of the country. Convert abbreviations to the full country name.)",
  "firstPoliticalUnit": "(The name of the first-order administrative division in which the event occurred, e.g., state or province. Use the name only and omit the political division tier.)",
  "secondPoliticalUnit": "(The name of the second-order administrative division in which the event occurred, e.g., county. Use the name only and omit the political division tier. If not present, insert N/A.)",
  "municipality": "(The city, town, or village in which the event occurred. If not present, insert N/A.)",
  "verbatimLocality": "(The original textual description of the place where the occurrence was recorded. Do not convert any abbreviated text or acronyms. Exclude coordinates, latitude, longitude, or elevation information. This should otherwise read precisely as it is on the label. If the first and second political units have been parsed out, do not repeat them here.)",
  "locality": "(The specific description of the place. Do not shorten units of measurement. Exclude coordinates, latitude, longitude, elevation, or habitat information. Include any place names, names of parks, etc. If no precise locality is found, insert '[precise locality unknown]'.)",
  "habitat": "(The description of the habitat in which the specimen was collected as described on the original label. This might be a description or summarization of all existing biotic and abiotic factors in the area that may assist in the survival and reproduction of the collected specimen.)",
  "verbatimElevation": "(The original verbatim text of the elevation (altitude) of the occurrence. Precisely as appearing on the label. If not present, insert N/A.)",
  "verbatimCoordinates": "(The original verbatim text of the coordinates. Precisely as appearing on the label. If not present, insert N/A.)",
  "otherCatalogNumbers": "(An identifier for the record within the dataset. This is not to be confused with the recordNumber. The otherCatalogNumbers may be a stamped number on the herbarium sheet. If not present, insert N/A.)",
  "originalMethod": "(The method by which the original data was recorded. Select from this list: Handwritten, Typed, Mix of Handwritten and Typed, Unsure.)",
  "typeStatus": "(If the specimen has 'type' written or typed on the label and can take the form holotype, isotype, etc., state as such. Otherwise, insert 'no type status'.)"
